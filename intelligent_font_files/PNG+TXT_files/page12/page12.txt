the mornings year round and the fire makes for a
warm inviting place to have some quiet time and just
in case you are thinking well yeah its easy for you
you have a cozy place to sit by a fire and gaze out
at the beautiful mountain keep in mind that for the
first seven years i awakened each morning in a cold
concrete bunker called a prison cell i would sit quietly
on my steel bunk surrounded by misery and austerity
i didnt have the fireplace then and i certainly wast
looking out at the mountains yet despite my reality
i imagined the life the awaited me beyond prison walls
i imagined the life of wealth and prosperity that was
my new destiny i pictured the life i would one day
have with my son once the fire is built i make my coff
and turn on the stereo to a very low volume and tune
it to the spa or zen channel on satellite radio i sit
down in a chair next to the fireplace and turn on a
soft lamp as i sit quietly soaking up the warmth
of the fire and listening to the soft music i revel
in the moment i dont regret the past or wonder about
the future i am completely absorbed in the moment
its very easy for us humans to relive past frustate
and hurts or to fret over the uncertain futre
