limiting beliefs can come from anywhere your fam
community and othersand develop at any time people
didnt put them there to be malicious rather they
were placed there to protect you to make sure you
arent disappointed by expecting too much out of
life they are there to ensure you arent hurt by
unreasonable expectations the way others were hurt
they are there to keep you grounded these beliefs
are the limitations that others who have accepted
mediocrity unwittingly placed on you they arent you
they belong to people who have surrendered who have
resigned themselves to their reality that exceptional
goals are unreasonable and because they belong to
others you have the right to return them you deser
to create your own expectations you have the power
to defy conventions but to do all of this you must
first find these beliefs and outwit them despite their
uncanny ability to prove to you that they arent
even there as you grew up those around you deposit
limiting beliefs into your box you accepted them as
truth and your reticular activating system ras began
the process of collecting information that reinfor
what you learned eventually that belief system
