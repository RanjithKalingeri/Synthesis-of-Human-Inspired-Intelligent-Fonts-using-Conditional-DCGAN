take each item you jotted down during the focus step
so far and write down just one or two things that if
done on a consistent basis would likely result in your
desired outcome dont worry about identifying every
that you could or should do just note one or two actions
that will immediate and powerful results remember keep
it simple the lions share of your results will come from
just a handful of your actions lets work with an exam
or two suppose you jotted down that your sales and buss
career goal is to earn an annual income of stop and
consider where you are in relation to that dream at this
point in your life what are the first steps you need to
take to make that dream a reality are you at a point in
your life where you already have a career and only need
to grow your business to get there or are you at a stage
where the first thing you need to do is learn the process
of selling because everyone is at a different stage pro
what you need to do is to reach your dreams depends on
where you are right now a successful salesperson may
need only to increase his number of cold calls to reach a
income whereas someone else may need to start by the
basics since my journey to creating wealth and prosper
began in a prison cell i had a very long way to go how
