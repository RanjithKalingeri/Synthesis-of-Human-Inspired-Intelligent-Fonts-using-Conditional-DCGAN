as soon as i finished there i drove to philadelphia
where i spoke for several hours that evening i flew
back to denver on thursday morning and arrived at the
airport at about am i then drove hours to my office
and spend an hour with my staff after that i drove
up to my home in the mountains about miles west of the
city i rested for about an hour at home then got ready
to travel to the womens prison about 15 hours south
when i pulled into the prison parking lot at pm i was so
tired i could barely see straight as i entered the facility
and waited in the prison visiting room for the guards
to bring the women in i seriously wondered if i had
overextended myself however any hint of doubt the
moment i began speaking i knew immediately that i was
in the exact place i was supposed to be the look of hope
and excitement on the womens face was inspiring they
were committed to changing the course of their lives and
were passionate about implementing the habits principles
the point is that we all have an obligation to serve others
and sometimes we must put the needs of others before our
own desires on that evening i wanted more than anything
to just go home and crash but i did what i had promised
to do and helped countless individuals including myself
