the bottom line is this you dont have to think every
you believe and you dont have to believe everything
you think you can control what goes into and
through your mind you can become the captain of
your thoughts lets take a look at some common limit
beliefs that live in your thoughts as well as some
specific examples that demonstrate their subtle
nature several years ago i noticed some tendencies i
had when it came to my diet i usually filled my plate
with large portions and would eat every speck of food
in front of me the belief that triggered these actions
was buried deep down and in fluenced my behaviour
very subtly in fact i didnt even realize the behavior
was dysfunctional thats the nature of limiting
beliefs they are such a part of us that we often cant
even see how out of wack they are eventually i came
to see that this attitude toward eating was causing
problems in my life the older i got the more difficult
it became for me to keep my weight down as i looked
within and sought to discover the source of this
tendency i remembered how safe and secure i felt when
my mother cooked four our family when i was a kid
there was something about the warmth and security
