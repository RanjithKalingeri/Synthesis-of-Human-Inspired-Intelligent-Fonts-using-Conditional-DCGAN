experts i needed to set up an accounting dpartment
obtain the appropriate licensing and get liability worker
compensation and unemployment insurance i needed a
marketing plan a sales system and countless operations
processes there were literally hundreds if not thousands
of things to do so many in fact that it was easy to get
lost in the confusion of what to do next it was a small
company that didnt have the luxury of a large staff to
perform the myriad of tasks so instead of getting buried
in minutiae i decided to discern which leveraged activity
that would generate the most immediate and powerful result
relying on the basic business philosophy of ibm founder
thomas watson sr that nothing happen until something gets
sold i decided to focus my attention on selling something
but before i could sell anything i needed a sales lead with
an office an employee or a service truck i took out a
fullpage ad for our new company in our sunday news
announcing our lowest price ever since i hadnt been in
business the day before that was completely honest
claim at the bottom of the ad i put the words call now
operators standing by hours a day days a week i was
the operator the phone number was a cell
i was definitely standing by
