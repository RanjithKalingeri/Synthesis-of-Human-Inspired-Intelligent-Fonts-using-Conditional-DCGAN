its probably due to one or both of the following reasons
reason for these shortcomings is that the confused mind
says no this refers to our tendency to do nothing when
we become overwhelmed with too much to do most of us have
lists right now in our home or office with a gazillion
things that we need to do or that need to happen before
we move forward with an idea or project unfortunately
its easy to become overwhelmed with this seemingly
list of to dos which usually causes us to become parlyzed
and do nothing youve probably heard of the pareto princi
or the so called rule this says that percent of your
results come from percent of your efforts its a very helpful
tool to simplify our todo lists and make progress toward
our goals and aspirations the key is to focus your efforts
on the activities the produce the most significant results
i refer to these as leveraged actions simple acts that
produce extra ordinary results that are the key to
generating powerful outcomes in life and business we will
discuss which actions to take a little later in this chap
people also tend to wait until everything is perfect before
they take actions but waiting for everyone to be just right
before taking the plunge on a project will likely leave you
waiting for a long time circumstances are rarely ever
