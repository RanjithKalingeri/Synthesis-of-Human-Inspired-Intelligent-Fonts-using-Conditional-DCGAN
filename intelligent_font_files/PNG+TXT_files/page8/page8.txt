journey to wealth happiness and peace of mind and
this journey begins with a single step now that you
have a clear vision of your exceptional life and b
well as a list of things you need to do to get there
the next step is to organize that information into you
prosperity plan however before we move on to that
step you must do one more thing understand any limit
beliefs you have that may undermine potential success
limiting beliefs are the biggest obstacle between you
and an exceptional life and business there is no bigger
threat to unimaginable wealth happiness and pros
than the accumulation of restrictive beliefs that live
in your box therefore if you are going to reach your
true potential in life and business you must figure out
what these are and start working on getting them out
the biggest challenge to discovering and addressing
your limiting beliefs is the fact that by their very
nature they are difficult to recognize the reason they
so limiting is because theyre so suble and hard to
detect they are camouflaged into the very fabric of
your own thought process and way of life after all
if you could discern them easly it wouldnt be as hard
to identify and discard them but limiting beliefs
